Insertion Sort Algorithm

Overview

Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly taking one element from an unsorted list and inserting it into its correct position in a sorted list.

How It Works

- Start: Begin with the second element in the array.
- Insertion: Compare the current element with the elements before it and insert it into the correct position in the sorted portion of the array by shifting the other elements to the right side
- Repeat: Continue this process for all elements in the array, gradually expanding the sorted portion until the entire array is sorted.

Implementation

The insertionSort function takes an array as input and sorts it using the Insertion Sort algorithm. It uses two counters, i and j, to iterate through the array and the sorted portion of the array.

Evaluation Criteria

This implementation fulfills the following criteria:

- Uses 2 counters (i and j).
- Implements the Insertion Sort algorithm correctly.
